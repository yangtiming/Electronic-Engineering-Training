Electronic-Engineering-Training smart car

## Introduction


### Function Module:

(1) IAP15K4W58S MCU main control module (2) L298N double H-bridge driver module

(3) LCD12864 display module

(4) Bluetooth communication module

(5) Ultrasonic obstacle avoidance module

This design is mainly divided into two parts: hardware architecture and software control. The control core of the overall design is single-chip microcomputer, and the main control chip is IAP15K4W58S single-chip microcomputer of STC company

### The experimental content is divided into the following levels:

(1) Design and welding to realize various running states of the car, including start and stop, forward and backward, acceleration and deceleration, left and right turn, etc.;

(2) Use LCD and other display devices to monitor the running state of the car, display the running state and running speed, etc.

(3) Design and welding to realize the running state of wireless data transmission control car.

(4) Realize wireless data transmission through Bluetooth, and then remote control the various running states of the car;

(5) Automatic obstacle avoidance based on ultrasonic sensor.


### 实验内容分为以下几个层次:

(1) 设计并焊接实现小车的各种运行状态，包括启动停止、前进倒退、加速减 速 左转右转等;

(2) 使用 LCD 等显示器件监测小车的运行状态，显示运行状态及运行速度挡 位 等。

(3) 设计并焊接实现无线数据传输控制小车的运行状态。

(4) 通过蓝牙实现无线数据传输，进而遥控小车的各种运行状态;

(5) 基于超声波传感器实现小车自动避障。
